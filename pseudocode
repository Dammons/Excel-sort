so everythings kinda already sorted, as the gender entries are in different columns in the table depending on data 
like all gender responses from ages 14-17 are in column CD, and all gender responses for ages 45-59 are in CG

we create 18 separate spreadsheets, one for each age/gender combination

this way we 

*open document command*
*open other 18 documents command*
for (i=0, i<=largest row number, i++)
{
select row number i;
If(value from row in column [CG,CC,CE, etc] =/= null and entry string=given gender value [such as male, female, nonbinary]){
place that row’s value in this doc
}else{
go back to the beginning of the if statement
}
}

actually you know what on second thought the if statement may not be the best thing standalone maybe like 2 for loops
or maybe just a bunch of if statements
but that’d be like 18 nested if’s right because you can’t necessarily
